(1)The worst time complexity for the pop() fucntion of the Stack would be O(1) because it is not a linear function. 
The pop function does not need to iterate through every member in the list, in the case of using a vector we only need to access the topmost element within it. 
Therefore, it would be O(1) because pop can be accomplished in constant time.

(2)The worst time complexity for the postfix_calc(string) function would be O(n) because it is linear. 
Unlike the pop function, that post fix function depends on the number of characters within the string expression. 
Therefore it needs to evaluate each character independently. Therefore, it would be O(n) because it is accomplished in a linear manner.
